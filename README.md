# GEOFFREY CHAUCER
The first thing which forcibly strikes our attention in tracing the
Homes and Haunts of the Poets, is the devastation which Time has 
made among them. As if he would indemnify himself for the
degree of exemption from his influence in their works, he lays
waste their homes and annihilates the traces of their haunts with an
active and a relentless hand. If this is startingly apparent in the
cases of those even who have been our cotemporaries, how much
more must it be so in the cases of those who have gone hence
centuries ago. We begin with the father of our truly English poetry,
the genial old Geoffrey Chaucer, and, spite of the lives which have
been written of him, Tyrwhitt tells us that just nothing is really
known of him. The whole of his account of what he considers
well-authenticated facts regarding him amounts to but twelve
pages, including notes and comments. The facts themselves do not
fill more than four pages. Of his birth-place, further than
that it was in London, as he tells us himself in The Testament of
Love, fol. 321, nothing is known. The place of his education is by
no means clear. It has been said that he was educated first at
Cambridge, and then at Oxford. He himself leaves it pretty certain
that he was at Cambridge, styling himself, in The Court of Love,
"Philogenet of Cambridge, Clerk." Leland has asserted that he was
at Oxford; and Wood, in his Annals, gives a tradition that, "when
Wickliffe was guardian or warden of Canterbury College, he had
for his pupil the famous poet called Jeffrey Chaucer, father of
Thomas Chaucer, Esq., of Ewelme, in Oxfordshire, who, following
the steps of his master, reflected much upon the corruptions of the
clergy."
He is then said to have entered himself of the Inner Temple.
Speght states that a Mr. Buckley had seen a record in the Inner
Temple of "Geffrey Chaucer being fined two shillings for beating a
Franciscan Friar in Fleet-street." This, Tyrwhitt says, was a
youthful sally, and points out the fact that Chaucer studied in the
Inner Temple on leaving college, and before his travels abroad,
which is contrary to the account of Leland, who makes him, after
his travels, reside in the Inner Temple. These travels even in 
France resting solely on the authority of Leland, Tyrwhitt disputes,
but of their reality there can be little doubt.
Chaucer, having finished his education, became a courtier. The
first authentic memorial, says Tyrwhitt, that we have of him, is the
patent in Rymer, 41 E. III., by which the king grants him an
annuity of twenty marks, by the title of Valettus noster. He was
then in the 39th year of his age. Speght mentions a succeeding
grant by the title of Valettus hospitii. By those titles it appears that
he was a royal page or groom. In this situation he enjoyed various
grants from the king. In the 48 E. III., he had, according to Rymer,
a grant for life of a pitcher of wine dayly; in the same year a grant,
during pleasure, of the office of Controller of the Custom of Wools, &c., in the port of London. The next year
the king granted him the wardship of Sir Edmund Staplegate's heir,
for which he received Â£104; and in the following year, some
forfeited wool to the value of 71, 4s., 6d. His annuity of twenty
marks was confirmed to him on the accession of Richard II., and
another annuity of twenty marks was granted him in lieu of the
dayly pitcher of wine. It is probable, too, that he was confirmed in
his office of controller, though the instrument has not been
produced. In the 13th of Richard II. he appears to have been clerk
of the works at Westminster, &c., and in the following year at
Windsor. In the 17th of Richard II. the king granted him a new
annuity of twenty pounds; in the 22d, a pipe of wine. On the
accession of Henry IV. his two grants of the annuity of twenty
pounds and of the pipe of wine were confirmed to him, with an
additional grant of forty marks.
Thus it appears that Chaucer did not miss the profitable part of
court patronage. He also reaped some of its honorable
employments. Edward III., in the 46th year of his reign, appointed
him, with two others, his envoy to Genoa, with the title of Scutifer
noster, Our Squire. This great and able king, it is evident, regarded 
Chaucer as a good man of business, and that he proved himself so,
is pretty well denoted by the chief grants of his life immediately
following his return; namely, that of the pitcher of wine dayly, the
controllership of the customs of wool and wine in the port of
London, and in the following year of the wardship of Sir Edmund
Staplegate's heir, &c. At the heels of these grants came also
another embassy to France, with Sir Guichard d'Angle and Richard
Stan, according to Froissart, to treat of a marriage between the
Prince of Wales, afterward Richard II., and a daughter of the
French king. Other historians assert that the original object of his
mission was to complain of some infringement of the truce
concluded with France, and which was so well pushed by
Chaucer and his colleagues, that it led to some overtures respecting
the marriage. However that may be, it is evident that our poet's part
in the transaction met with the royal approbation, for the old king
dying, one of the first acts of the prince, on his accession, was to
confirm his father's grants to him, with an additional one, as we
have observed.
But Chaucer had also his share of life's reverses. In the eleventh
year of Richard II. he had the king's license to surrender his two
grants of twenty marks each, in favor of John Scalby. It is not
really known why he surrendered those grants, but it is supposed
that it was owing to his connection with the Lollard cause, and
especially to his alliance with John of Gaunt, the Duke of
Lancaster, and John of Northampton. He was not only attached to
the duke on account of their common interest in the reformed
opinions, but he was married to a sister of Catharine Swynford, the
duke's mistress, and afterward wife. Chaucer, it seems, had exerted
himself zealously to secure the re-election of John of Northampton
as Lord-mayor of London. There is much mystery attached to the
cause of the riot and its consequences which took place; but as this
Comberton, or John of Northampton, was a zealous Wickliffite, the
supposition that the disturbance arose from the violent opposition 
of the clergy to him is very probable. Comberton was finally
committed to prison, and Chaucer fled, first to Hainault, then to
France, and lastly to Zealand. "While in Zealand," says Mr.
Chalmers, "he maintained some of his countrymen, who had fled
thither on the same account, by sharing the money he had brought
with him, an act of liberality which soon exhausted his stock. In
the mean time, the partisans of his cause, whom he had left at
home, contrived to make their peace, not only without endeavoring
to procure a pardon for him, but without aiding him in his exile,
where he became greatly distressed for want of pecuniary supplies.
Such ingratitude, we may suppose, gave him more uneasiness than the consequences of it; but it did
not lessen his courage, as he soon ventured to return to England.
On this he was discovered, and committed to the Tower, where,
after being treated with great rigor, he was promised his pardon if
he would disclose all he knew, and put it in the power of the
government to restore the peace of the city. His former resolution
appears now to have failed him; or, perhaps, indignation at the
ungrateful conduct of his associates, induced him to think
disclosure a matter of indifference. It is certain that he complied
with the terms offered; but we are not told what was the amount of
his confession, or what the consequences were to others, or who
they were that he informed against. We know only that he obtained
his liberty, and that an oppressive share of blame and obloquy
followed. To alleviate his regret for this treatment, and partly to
vindicate his own conduct, he now wrote The Testament of Love;
and although this piece, from want of dates and obscurity of style,
is not sufficient to form a very satisfactory biographical document,
it at least furnishes the preceding account of his exile and return."
This account is attended with its difficulties. Chalmers states this
exile to have occurred about the 3d or 4th of Richard II.; Tyrwhitt
in the eleventh of that reign. One thing is certain, that if it occurred
in the eleventh, the whole period of his exile and troubles lasted 
only two years; for in the 13th of Richard II. he was in great favor
at court, and made clerk of the works at Westminster. Again, the
two years during which he claimed protection from the king are
stated by Chalmers to be from the 2d of Richard, and by Tyrwhitt,
quoting Rymer, are dated from the twenty-first of that reign. It
appears, however, pretty certain that he was reduced to great
pecuniary distress, and obliged to screen himself from the
persecutions of his creditors under the royal grant of protection.
There can be little doubt that Rymer is the correct authority, and
that it occurred in the 21st of Richard. About the time of the termination of this grant
of protection, he would see his protector also reduced to the need
of protection himself; which he did not find, but was deposed, and
succeeded by Henry IV., who confirmed to our poet the grants of
the unfortunate monarch Richard.
